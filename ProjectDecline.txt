Hi Chairman,

I'm sorry to hear that the project presentation has been cancelled. Given the circumstances, I understand that the initial agreement may not be feasible. Considering the work and risk involved in developing the Smart Stick 1.8, I believe a token of appreciation would be in order.

Would it be possible to discuss a compensation of 200 GHC, acknowledging the efforts and risks taken on during the project development? I'm open to further discussion and finding a mutually agreeable solution.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Asiedu Development Hub
